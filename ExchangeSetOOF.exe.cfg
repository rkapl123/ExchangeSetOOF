// First Line: prefix that defines OOF reply bodies to act as a template (case insensitive)
// Second line: tab separated array of placeholders and replacements for DateLang1 (e.g. German), being replaced using following rule (hardcoded):
// DateLangX[0] (!ToDate!) changed to DateLangX[4] (bis/until) + " " + OOF_EndDate
// DateLangX[1] (!FromDateToDate!) changed to DateLangX[3] (from) + " " + OOF_StartDate + " " + DateLangX[4] (until) + " " + OOF_EndDate
// in case of whole single day absences both DateLangX[0] and DateLangX[1] 
// are being replaced by DateLangX[2] (am/on) + " " + OOF_EndDate 
// Examples for the above setting: 
// "I'm on holiday !FromDateToDate!" would be changed to "I'm on holiday from 01/12/2005 until 05/12/2005" (for an absence that was found in the calendar from 01/12/2005 to 05/12/2005).
// For a single day absence only on 01/12/2005 it would be "I'm on holiday on 01/12/2005".
// "I'm on holiday !ToDate!" would be changed to "I'm on holiday until 05/12/2005" (for an absence that was found in the calendar from any day up to 05/12/2005).
// Third line: same as above for DateLang2 (e.g. English)
// Fourth line: tab separated array of fixed holiday dates to be regarded when going forward for the last day of absence (weekends are also regarded if the holiday dates are not empty. In order to ONLY regard weekends, just fill any value in the holiday dates), in format day.month
// Fifth line: If filled with EASTER then regard Easter Monday, Ascension day, Whit Monday, Corpus Christi day as holidays, if filled with EASTERGF then also regard Good Friday as a holiday.
